This will eventually become a sound editor for the 
Yamaha FB-01. It's like  3/4ths of a DX7 in a half
half rack unit with no knobs and a 16 digit display.
It's like, the hipsterest midi module of all time.
You've probably never heard of it.

Hence the awesome name.

Presently it's just a MIDI monitor, though, because
I'm still wrapping my head around how to deal with
all this totally 80's binary data in javascript. 

I might build a sound editor for the MicroKorg while I'm at it
since I have one of those to play with as well. 
Heck, I might even build some sorta modular infrastructure where
one could code up sound editors for all sorts of ancient midi 
hardware and just drop 'em in the same gui. 

I dunno. That's all sorta grandiose

I'm workin' on it, y'know?
maybe it'll happen. Maybe it won't.

that's why its called a "hobby" LOL
