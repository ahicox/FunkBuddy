things on the to do list:

    1) get midi in/out working with IAC bus
    2) validate midi out hot-swap works with a physical port
    3) extract all of the midi encoding / decoding stuff to a midiMessage class
       -> possibly publish this on NPM or back to the node-midi project on github
    4) start figuring out what sysex to send to the FB-01 to do voicing
